# OpenAC
Open Artificial Intelligence Compute Framework

Open AI Compute (OpenAC) is a framework for developing efficient AI (Artificial Intelligence) computing systems across heterogeneous platforms consisting of CPUs, GPUs, DSPs, FPGAs, and other ASSPs and ASICs, for both cloud and client applications.

## Why OpenAC

Computing industry is witnessing a boom of customized AI accelerators (FPGAs, ASICs and ASSPs), which . At the same time, are evolving very fast. A set of recommended (standard) APIs with which devices can be easily integrated to host system
 - Enable computing on heterogeneous devices
 - Efficiently used and integrated in cloud
 - Easily integrated to client devices
How to adapt to DL frameworks (Caffe, Tensorflow, Theano, Tensorflow, CNTK, Keras, Torch â€¦)
How to support both inference and training
A good standard will boost the customized computing (FPGA, ASICs and ASSPs) eco-system
